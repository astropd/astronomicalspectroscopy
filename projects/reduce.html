<p> <b>Due:</b>1 Jun 2017 </p>

<p>
<b>Description: </b> The goal of this project is to reduce and analyze a set of SALT observations.  

The data set can be downloaded from <a href='http://www.saao.ac.za/~crawford/tutorial/spec_tut.tar.gz'> here </a>.   The basic processing has already been taken care of by SALT, only the spectroscopic reduction steps (wavelength calibration, sky subtraction, and extraction) need to be carried out.  For best results, cosmic ray cleaning needs to be run on the data as well.  The source of interest is the spectra in the middle of the frame.  <br>

<p>
Once the data have been reduced, main features and lines should be identified in the spectra, and the feature should be classified.  For each of the lines, measure the wavelength center and total flux by fitting a Guassian to the line.   From the wavelength center, estimate the redshift for the object.   All values should be reported with uncertainties. <br>

<p>
PySALT can be <a href='https://github.com/saltastro/pysalt/wiki/Installing-with-Anaconda'> installed using anaconda </a> and a <a href='https://github.com/saltastro/pysalt/wiki/Long-Slit-Reductions'> PySALT tutorial </a> is also available.<br>


<p> <b> Submission:</b> An ipython notebook or pdf report should be submitted with presenting your work and results.  The final results should include the steps taken to reduce the spectra, the results, and how those results were derived. Please include the final spectra and any code written for the project.
