In the n=3 states, what are the different orbital levels which are possible? And what is the total number of different states (mj values) are available for each of those orbital levels?\n",

For a source with a gray spectrum (ie flat at all wavelengths) and an intensity of I=5x10$^{-15}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$/Angstrom passing through a hydrogen cloud with a radius of 50 pc and a density of 1 particle/cm$^3$, plot how  the intensity will change as a function of wavelength from Hydrogen continuum abosption.
