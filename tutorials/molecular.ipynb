    "1) Interstellar CO is observed absorbing infrared radiation at 2134.63, 2138.46, 2146.16, and 21533.94 cm$^{-1}$.  Identify the transitions observed in this spectra and explain what astrophyscial information might be obtained from this study.   Where might one expect to observe an infrared spectrum of CO in absorption or emission? "
